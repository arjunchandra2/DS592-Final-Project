# DS592-Final-Project

This repo contains code which implements the algorithms from the paper *Fair Algorithms for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits* (NeurIPS 2021). There are several notebooks:
- `nsw.ipynb`: Visualizing Nash Social Welfare for 3 agents and 3 arms 
- `etc.ipynb`: Implementing Explore-then-Commit (Algorithm 1)
- `eg.ipynb`: Implementing Epislon-Greedy (Algorithm 2)
- `ucb.ipynb`: Implementing UCB (Algorithm 3)

There are some basic imports needed for each notebook. After installing these libraries, you should be able to run each cell in the notebook sequentially without issues to run the simulations and reproduce the plots. The plots are also located in `figures`.
